Fedora is a popular open source Linux-based operating system.\
Fedora is designed as a secure, general purpose operating system. The operating system is developed on a six-month release cycle, under the auspices of the Fedora Project. Fedora is sponsored by Red Hat.\
According to the Fedora Project, Fedora is "always free for anyone to use, modify, and distribute." Fedora is said to be the second-most commonly used Linux distribution, after Ubuntu. There are over a hundred distributions based on Fedora, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project's XO operating system.
