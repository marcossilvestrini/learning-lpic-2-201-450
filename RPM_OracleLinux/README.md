The Oracle Linux operating system is engineered for open cloud
infrastructure. It delivers leading performance, scalability, reliability and
security for enterprise SaaS and PaaS workloads as well as traditional
enterprise applications. Oracle Linux Support offers access to award-winning
Oracle support resources and Linux support specialists, zero-downtime
updates using Ksplice, additional management tools such as Oracle
Enterprise Manager and lifetime support, all at a low cost. Unlike many other
commercial Linux distributions, Oracle Linux is easy to download and
completely free to use, distribute and update.
